## 🧮 Technical Implementation

### Age Calculation Algorithm
```
// Handles month/day borrowing for accurate results
function getAgeBreakdown(dob, today) {
  let years = today.getFullYear() - dob.getFullYear();
  let months = today.getMonth() - dob.getMonth();
  let days = today.getDate() - dob.getDate();
  
  // Handle negative days/months with proper borrowing
  if (days < 0) {
    months--;
    days += new Date(today.getFullYear(), today.getMonth(), 0).getDate();
  }
  if (months < 0) {
    years--;
    months += 12;
  }
  
  return { years, months, days };
}
```

### Next Birthday Logic
- Calculates next occurrence of birth date
- Handles year transitions automatically  
- Provides human-readable date format
- Counts down days remaining
